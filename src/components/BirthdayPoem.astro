      Dear Daddoo,
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-6">
      In the grand game of life, you're our MVP,
      Though sometimes the players' names escape your memory.
      Like when AJ Brown makes a spectacular play,
      And you shout "Look at Cook!" in your endearing way.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-6">
      From Notre Dame victories to family dinners divine,
      Your joy and your love make everything shine.
      Your predictions were right about USC's fate,
      Even if player recognition isn't always so great.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-6">
      At Legends we gather, making memories so bright,
      Your smile lights up every wonderful night.
      And though names might get jumbled in that brilliant mind,
      A father more loving would be hard to find.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl text-purple-300 italic text-center">
      So here's to you, Daddoo, our guiding light,
      Making every moment perfectly right.
      Whether cheering for Notre Dame or mixing up names,
      Your love and your spirit win all of life's games.
    </p>
